                <h2> Our Product</h2>
                <p>
                Our team has come up with an exciting prototype design that includes a companion smart watch to go hand-in-hand with the customer's smart mirror in their closet. We wanted to create a dynamic and functional duo that seamlessly integrates into the user's wardrobe, offering both convenience and personalization. We have called this product StyleSync, with is a suite of products that feature an app experience (wearable and on mobile device) called StyleLink as well as a stand-alone mirror product called Magic Mirror. Our Style Sync product allows the user to stand in front of the Magic Mirror and displays a live projection of their clothing items on their reflection. Not only that, but it also provides helpful details like how many times each item was worn, its cleanliness level with info about damages or stains, where the item was bought, the fabric type, and even when it was last worn. However, our suite of products goes beyond just showing what's in the user’s wardrobe. Style Sync will suggest outfit combinations based on the day's weather and occasion. And if there’s a need our product provides shopping inspirations by sending the user notifications with personalized recommendations. All of this control is at the user’s fingertips with our companion smartwatch experience, Style Link. Style Link allows the user to easily navigate through clothing options with simple air gestures for quick actions or direct control through the touch screen. Moreover, Style Sync allows our users to share their style recommendations with friends or find new clothing items based on their current collection with our integrated sync functions.
